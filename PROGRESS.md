# BT-Member Event Management — Progress Snapshot

## Day 2 Complete — Tasks, User Admin, Email Cron, Polish

---

## What Was Built — Day 1 Foundation

**Project Setup**
- Next.js 14 (pages router), Tailwind CSS, ESLint
- Dependencies: `next-auth`, `@auth/supabase-adapter`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `resend`
- `.env.local.example` with all required keys
- `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `jsconfig.json`
- Tabler Icons loaded via CDN in `globals.css`

**Supabase**
- `supabase/schema.sql` — 7 tables with RLS:
  - `events`, `users`, `event_members`, `activities`, `tasks`, `announcements`, `email_log`
- `supabase/seed.sql` — seed event: BT Annual Event 2026 (slug: 2026-annual-event)
- Schema deployed live to Supabase via `scripts/run-schema.js`

**Lib Files (Day 1)**
- `lib/supabase/server.js` — server-side Supabase client (anon key)
- `lib/supabase/client.js` — browser Supabase singleton
- `lib/auth.js` — NextAuth config (Google provider, upserts user on sign-in)
- `lib/constants.js` — ICONS (10), STATUS_LIST, ROLES

**API Routes (Day 1)**
- `GET/POST /api/events`
- `GET/POST /api/activities?slug=` and `PUT/DELETE /api/activities/[id]`
- `GET/POST /api/announcements?event_id=`
- `GET /api/tasks?slug=` (basic)
- `GET /api/users?event_id=` (basic)
- `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`

**Components (Day 1)**
- `Layout.jsx` — nav bar with event name, page links, user avatar, admin-only Users link
- `ActivityCard.jsx` — icon, lead/co-lead, progress bar, edit/delete (admin)
- `ActivityForm.jsx` — modal create/edit with IconPicker, lead/co-lead selects
- `IconPicker.jsx` — dropdown of 10 Tabler icons
- `Avatar.jsx` — initials circle or Google photo
- `StatusBadge.jsx` — open/in_progress/done/overdue with color coding

**Pages (Day 1)**
- `/` — Module home: event grid, active event highlighted, admin Add Event button
- `/[slug]` — Event login: Google sign-in, redirect to dashboard if already authed
- `/[slug]/dashboard` — Stats row, My Tasks, Activity Progress with progress bars
- `/[slug]/activities` — Activity grid + Announcements section with admin post form
- `/[slug]/tasks` — Stub task list

**Day 1 Deployment Fixes**
- Added `jsconfig.json` — `@/` path alias was not resolving
- Fixed RLS policy on `events` — changed to `USING (true)` for public home page
- Rewrote activities API — replaced broken Supabase join syntax with separate queries
- Added `Array.isArray()` guards in dashboard and activities pages
- Switched `lib/auth.js` to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for user upsert
- Added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.local.example` and Vercel env vars

## What Was Built — Day 2

### Auth Fixes
- `lib/auth.js` — rewrote `requireAdmin` for pages router (`req, res` pattern, returns `true` if blocked)
- `lib/auth.js` — fixed session callback to return best role across all event memberships (admin > lead > member)

### Task Management

**API**
- `GET /api/tasks?slug=&activity_id=&status=` — enhanced with filters; joins assignee1/assignee2 user data; overdue computed server-side
- `POST /api/tasks` — create task (admin/lead only); requires `title`, `activity_id`, `assignee_1_id`
- `PUT /api/tasks/[id]` — status toggle (assignees or admin only) or full edit (admin/lead only)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` — admin only

**Components**
- `components/TaskItem.jsx` — checkbox (assignees only), title, StatusBadge, up to 2 assignee avatars, due date, edit button (admin/lead), deep-link highlight ring
- `components/TaskForm.jsx` — create/edit modal: title, activity select, status, assignee 1/2, due date; Delete task button triggers confirm dialog

**Page — `/[slug]/tasks`** (full rewrite)
- Filter bar: activity dropdown + status dropdown (all/open/in_progress/done/overdue)
- Add Task button (admin/lead only)
- Tasks partitioned into 4 sections: Overdue, In Progress, Open, Done
- Deep link: `?id=<task_id>` highlights and scrolls to matching task
- Loading spinner, empty states, error boundary

### User Admin

**API**
- `GET /api/users?event_id=` — enhanced to return `role`, `joined_at`, `status` (`active`|`invited`) per member; without `event_id` returns active-only list for form selects
- `POST /api/users/invite` — looks up user by email; creates placeholder row (`name=null`) if not found; adds to `event_members`; admin only
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` — inline role change; admin only
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]?event_id=` — remove from event_members; admin only

**Components**
- `components/InviteForm.jsx` — modal: email + role select; POSTs to `/api/users/invite`

**Page — `/[slug]/admin/users`** (new)
- Admin-only (redirects non-admins to dashboard)
- Team table: avatar, name, email, inline role dropdown, status badge, trash button
- Pending invites section at bottom (users with `name IS NULL`)
- Confirm dialog before remove; cannot remove self

**Pending invite tracking:** Users invited by email but not yet signed in have `name=null` in the `users` table. When they sign in via Google OAuth, the upsert fills in their name — distinguishing them from active members automatically.

### Email Cron (Resend + React Email)

**Packages added:** `@react-email/components`, `@react-email/render`

**Email Templates**
- `emails/DailyDigest.jsx` — assigned tasks list with status, due date, deep-link button; reply-to footer
- `emails/LeadDigest.jsx` — all activity tasks grouped by status (In Progress / Open / Done)
- `emails/OverdueReminder.jsx` — overdue tasks with red highlight, due date, deep-link button
- `emails/Announcement.jsx` — message content, sender name, date

**`lib/email.js`** — Resend helper functions:
- `sendDailyDigest(user, tasks, slug, eventId)` — logs to `email_log` (type: daily_digest)
- `sendLeadDigest(user, activity, tasks, slug, eventId)` — logs to `email_log` (type: daily_digest)
- `sendOverdueReminder(user, tasks, slug, eventId)` — logs to `email_log` (type: overdue_reminder)
- `sendAnnouncement(members, message, senderName, eventName, eventId)` — bulk send; logs to `email_log` (type: announcement)

**`/api/cron/daily-digest`** — Vercel cron endpoint
- Protected: `x-cron-secret` header must match `CRON_SECRET` env var
- Iterates active events; for each event:
  1. Sends consolidated OverdueReminder to each assignee with overdue tasks (deduped by `email_log`)
  2. Sends DailyDigest to every member (their assigned tasks)
  3. Sends LeadDigest to each activity's lead + co-lead
- Deep link format: `https://bt.cyber-tech.com/[slug]/tasks?id=[task_id]`

**`vercel.json`** — cron schedule: `0 14 * * *` (14:00 UTC = 7:00 AM Pacific)

### Polish
- `components/Spinner.jsx` — used on tasks and users pages during loading
- `components/ConfirmDialog.jsx` — used before all delete/remove actions
- `components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` — React class boundary wrapping tasks page content
- Empty state messages on all list sections
- Add Task button conditionally visible (admin/lead only)
- Confirm dialog before task delete and member removal

---

## Current State (after Day 2)

- bt.cyber-tech.com live; build clean (no errors, 19 routes)
- Full task CRUD: create, edit, status toggle, delete with confirm
- User admin: invite by email, inline role change, remove member, pending invite display
- Daily email cron wired for Vercel (7 AM Pacific); 4 email templates ready
- All pages have loading spinners and empty states
- `CRON_SECRET` added to `.env.local.example` — must also be added to Vercel env vars

---

## Pending / Next Steps (Day 3)

- Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables
- Trigger announcement emails from the Activities page (currently only posted to DB)
- Test Google sign-in end-to-end with real user, verify role propagation
- Seed activities with real lead user IDs (vlin77@gmail.com is now admin)
- Consider adding per-event role context (currently uses highest role across all events)
- Mobile layout review
